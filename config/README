General consideration for configuration files.

General configuration -- configuration.yaml
=============================================================


 DataSources:
   Source1:   DataSource name
     config:    Configuration file for this datasource.
     data:      Input files.
   Source2:
     ...
   SourceN:
     ...

 Processes:    Number of processes used by the program. Use a number between 1 and the number of cores of 				your system.

 Online: 	Boolean variable to determine if online or offline mode. Online mode for real time application (only one process). Offline mode for processing already stored data sets (multiprocess).

 Chunk_size:   Size of the chunk of files that are being processed at 
 	        the same time (Kilobytes)
 Output:
   dir:       Output directory to write the output files.
   stats:     Log file to write the stats (lines, records, matches).

 Deparsing_output: 
  dir:          Output directory for deparsing process
 treshold:     upper limit of log entries by datasource. 

 SPLIT:        split params for temporal samplig
   Time:
     window:   time windows for sampling in seconds
     start:    start and end time for sampling interval
     end:  
   




Source configuration -- datsource.yaml
=============================================================

General attributes 

tag:   Identifier of the data source

structured:   boolean variable to determine if the source is structured or not

timestamp_format: format of the timestamp of the logs in the files of this dataSource in python
                  datetime format, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior




timestamp_regexp: regular expresion that matches the date format of the source (only needed for unstructured sources)


separator:  **Only for unsstructured sources** chars that delimitates the log entries of the source (only needed in unstructured sources)

timearg: **Only for structured sources** position of the time stamp 


VARIABLES:

- name:      Variable name.
  matchtype: Variable matchtype {string, number, counter, ip, time, duration}.
  where:     Position of the field in the line (number for structured sources and regexp for unstructured sources.)

*** IMPORTANT NOTE *** 
There must be a variable called timestamp that collects the timestamps as strings.
*** IMPORTANT NOTE *** 


FEATURES:
   - name:      Feature name.
     variable:  Variable from which the feature is calculated.
     matchtype: Feature matchtype {single, multiple, range, default}
     value:     Value of the field that defines the feature.
                If the matchtype is 'single' use a single value.
                If the matchtype is 'multiple', use a list of values.
                If the matchtype is 'range', use a list of two values.
                If the matchtype is 'default', the value must be empty.
