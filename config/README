General consideration for configuration files.

General configuration file -- configuration.yaml
=============================================================

 DataSources:
   Source1:        DataSource name
     config:         Configuration file for this datasource.
     data:           Input files.
   Source2:
     ...
   SourceN:
     ...

 Processes:           Number of processes used by the program. Use a number between 1 and the number of cores of your system. If not specified, it is set to 8 by default.
 Online:              Boolean variable to determine if online or offline mode. Online mode for real time application (only one process)
                      while offline mode for processing already stored data sets (multiprocess).
                      
 SPLIT:        Timestamp visualization
   Time:        
     window      time windows for sampling in minutes. If not specified, it is set to 5 minutes by default.
     start:      start time for sampling interval. It must be specified in format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
     end:        end time for sampling interval.
                      
 - Parsing parameters: 
 Incremental_output:  Boolean variable for incremental features. If true and output files exist, new counters are added to the old ones. If not specified, it is set to False by default.
 Max_chunck:          Size of the chunk of files that are being processed at the same time (Megabytes). If not specified, it is set to 1MB by default.
 Parsing_Output:
   dir:          Output directory to write the output parsed data.
   stats:        Log file to write the stats (lines, records, matches).
   weights:       File which contains weights assigned to each feature in data source config. file
 Keys:           Key variable to aggregate dataSources. If empty, no aggregation is made. So, analyzed by timestamp

- Deparsing parameters:
 Deparsing_output: 
  dir:           Output directory for deparsing process
  treshold:      upper limit of log entries by datasource.  
  
- Learning parameters:
 Learning_Output:
   dir:          Output directory to write the output parsed data
 Lperc:       Proportion (percentage) of data used for learning.
 EndLperc:


Data Source configuration file -- datasource.yaml
=============================================================

General attributes:

tag: Identifier of the data source
structured: Boolean variable to indicate if the datasource is structured or not.
timestamp_format: format of the timestamp of the logs in the files of this dataSource in python datetime format.
                  Check: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
separator: char that delimitates the log entries of the source. It is mandatory for unstructured sources while for structured sources /n is considered if none is specified. 
timearg: Name of the timestamp variable.


VARIABLES:
  - name:       Variable name.
  - matchtype:  Variable matchtype {string, number, ip, time, duration}.
  - where:      Position of the field in the line (starts with 0), if structured datasource
                Regular expression that matches the wanted field, if unstructured datasource.

 Important note: There must be a variable (whose name is defined in timearg atrribute) which collects the timestamps, and it must be defined as time matchtype.


FEATURES:
  - name:       Feature name.
  - variable:   Variable from which the feature is calculated.
  - matchtype:  Feature matchtype {single, multiple, range, regexp, default}
  - value:      Value of the field that defines the feature.
                   If the matchtype is 'single' use a single value.
                   If the matchtype is 'multiple', use a list of values.
                   If the matchtype is 'range', use a list of two values.
                   If the matchtype is 'default', the value must be empty.
                   If the matchtype is 'regexp', the value is a string. (Regular expressions are only used in unstructured sources)
  - weight:     Optional parameter to assign different weights to the features, to be considered in deparsing process.
                if no weight is specified, its value is automatically set to one.
