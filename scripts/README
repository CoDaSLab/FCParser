Scripts
========

This folder contains some auxiliary tools used to explore, prepare and preprocess
the data. They don't take part in the parsing process itself.

- configure.py    Create variables configuration from a list of values.
                  This script is used to help in the creation of large
                  configuration for a datasource.

- discover.py     Discover all possible values of a given field.
                  This script is used to explore the data values of a field.

- filter.py       Filter data.
                  This script is used to select data records fulfilling certain
                  condition, reducing the noise and size of the data.

- search.py       Search fields values in datasources.
                  This script is used to explore the data looking for specific
                  values.
                  
- splitData.py    Split data by time intervals.
                  This script is used to divide data into temporal batches to 
                  emulate the online sampling.
                  
- select.py       Select data entries.
                  This script is used to select data records of a given value,
                  similar to the SQL SELECT function.

- addID.py	  Add flow ID to a csv file, as a last argument. This is required
                  as a preprocessing step for datasets that lack of flow ID.

- swapPorts.py    Correct direction of the flows, following the heuristic: 
                  When source port is lower than 1024 and the protocol is UDP
                  or TCP, swap direction of the flow (IPs and ports).
